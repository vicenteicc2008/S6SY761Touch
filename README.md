# Samsung SEC-S6SY761 Touchscreen Controller Driver for Windows
In this repository you can find the S6SY761 controller driver for Windows (KMDF).
This driver is not tested.

This repository has been originally forked from https://github.com/edk2-porting/nt36xxx_win, but now uses the vhidmini KMDF source driver as the base.

## Disclaimer
This driver is not finished.
It contains debug code and might be missing comments as well.

Have fun and tinker with code! =)
